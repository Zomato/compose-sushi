# üç£ Sushi: The Compose Multiplatform Design System by Zomato

---

## Picture This: One Design, Many Worlds üåè

Imagine this: You‚Äôve just crafted a stunning UI for your app. It looks perfect on Android. But on iPad, the fonts are off, buttons are squished, and your carefully chosen color palette feels completely off. On the desktop, the responsive layout falls apart. On the web? It‚Äôs chaos.

Sounds familiar? Welcome to the complex world of Compose Multiplatform UI, where your design system isn‚Äôt a standardized model, it needs to be an adaptive powerhouse, elegant on Android, sharp on iOS, pixel-perfect on desktop, and snappy on the web.

This is the story of how Zomato built Sushi: a design system as adaptable and consistent as your favourite dish from your go-to restaurant and as efficient as your food delivery order time. üçõ

## The Problem: One Design, Infinite Screens ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Building a design system for Compose Multiplatform goes beyond choosing color schemes or rounding button corners. It‚Äôs about:

- **Device Fragmentation:** Phones, tablets, desktops, foldables, TVs and smartwatches, all with varying screen sizes, DPIs, aspect ratios, and input methods.
- **Platform Quirks:** Android relies on Material Design, iOS follows Cupertino guidelines, and the web adheres to no single standard. A good design system must feel perfect on each platform while still retaining a consistent brand identity.
- **Consistency vs. Flexibility:** Your design should reflect your brand‚Äôs personality, but also allow teams to customize, iterate, and move quickly.
- **Performance:** Visual flourishes like animations, gradients and shadows are appealing, until they start affecting performance on low-end devices or browsers.

The traditional approaches, simply don‚Äôt  cut the modern requirements:
- **Copy-paste design:** Leads to a Frankenstein‚Äôs monster of styles.
- **Platform-only libraries:** Great for one OS, but a pain everywhere else.
- **One-size-fits-none:** The ‚Äúaverage‚Äù device is a myth.

We needed something better. Something delicious. üç£

## Introducing: Sushi! üç£

What if your design system could:
- **Look and feel amazing everywhere**‚Äîfrom Android to iOS, desktop to web?
- **Let you theme, customize, and extend** with just a few lines of code?
- **Ship with a buffet of ready-to-use components**‚Äîall beautiful, all consistent?
- **Scale from MVP to millions of users** (like we do at Zomato, and all ETERNAL apps)?

That‚Äôs Sushi, a Compose Multiplatform superpower. And today, we‚Äôre open-sourcing it for everyone. üéâ

## ü•¢ Why Sushi?

- **Multiplatform First:** Write once, run everywhere Compose runs (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web, and more).
- **Production Proven:** Sushi powers Zomato, serving millions of users daily (currently being used on Android).
- **Composable & Extensible:** Built on Jetpack Compose idioms, with a focus on flexibility and customizability at its core.
- **Beautiful by Default:** Carefully crafted color schemes, typography, and components.
- **Open Source:** Open, accessible and available for everyone! üéâ

## üöÄ Getting Started

Add Sushi to your Compose Multiplatform project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.eternal.kits:sushi-compose:<version>")
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Foundation Layer: Theming, Colors, and Typography

### üé® Theming with `SushiTheme`

Inspired by MaterialTheme, Sushi provides a powerful theming system tailored for Sushi's design language. Use SushiTheme to wrap your app or screen and provide consistent colors, typography, and dimensions throughout your UI.

```kotlin
SushiTheme(
    colorScheme = SushiColorScheme, // Choose from many built-in schemes!
    typography = SushiTypography,   // Customize or use defaults
    dimens = SushiDimension(),      // Spacing, corner radius, etc.
    fontSizeMultiplier = { it },    // For accessibility/font scaling
    colorTokenMapper = { SushiUnspecified.asColorSpec() } // Advanced: map tokens to colors
) {
    // Your UI here
}
```

#### `SushiTheme` Parameters
- `colorScheme`: The active color palette (see below for options!)
- `typography`: The font styles and weights
- `dimens`: Spacing and corner radius system
- `fontSizeMultiplier`: Function to scale font sizes (for accessibility)
- `colorTokenMapper`: Mapping for custom color tokens

Access theme values anywhere in your composables:
```kotlin
val colors = SushiTheme.colors
val typography = SushiTheme.typography
val dimens = SushiTheme.dimens
```

---

### üåà Color Schemes

Sushi offers extensive customisation with diverse color schemes each with light and dark variants. Some of the built-in schemes include **Red, Pink, Purple, Blue, Teal, Green, Yellow, Orange, Tangerine, Charcoal, Slate, Cider, Gold, Grey, Honey, Indigo, Lime, Onion, Avacado, Brown**

Each scheme is defined in `foundation/colorscheme/` and can be used like:
```kotlin
SushiTheme(colorScheme = sushiRedColorScheme()) { ... }
```

---

### üñåÔ∏è ColorSpec: Flexible Color Abstraction

Sushi introduces `ColorSpec`, a sealed interface that abstracts how colors are defined and accessed. This allows you to:
- Use Compose `Color` objects
- Use ARGB `Int` or `Long` values
- Use hex strings (e.g., `"#FF0000"`)
- Apply alpha transformations

#### Example Usage
```kotlin
val color1: ColorSpec = Color.Red.asColorSpec()
val color2: ColorSpec = 0xFFFF0000.toInt().asIntColorSpec()
val color3: ColorSpec = "#00FF00".asHexColorSpec()
val colorWithAlpha = color1.withAlpha(0.5f)
```

This makes it easy to theme and customize components, and to support dynamic or token-based color systems.

---

### üî§ TextTypeSpec: Powerful Typography

Typography in Sushi is handled via `TextTypeSpec`, a sealed interface that lets you:
- Use predefined text types (e.g., `SushiTextType.Regular400`)
- Wrap any Compose `TextStyle` as a spec
- Transform styles on the fly

#### Example Usage
```kotlin
val type: TextTypeSpec = SushiTextType.Bold700
val customType: TextTypeSpec = TextStyle(fontSize = 20.sp).asTextTypeSpec()
val modifiedType = type.transform { it.copy(letterSpacing = 1.sp) }
```

All text types are mapped to the theme‚Äôs typography, ensuring consistency across your app.
