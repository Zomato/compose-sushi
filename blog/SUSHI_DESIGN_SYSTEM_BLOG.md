# üç£ Sushi: The Compose Multiplatform Design System by Zomato

---

## Picture This: One Design, Many Worlds üåè

Imagine this: You‚Äôve just crafted a gorgeous UI for your food app. It looks perfect on your Android phone. But then you open it on your iPad‚Äîsuddenly, the fonts are off, the buttons are squished, and your beautiful color palette looks like it‚Äôs been through a blender. On desktop, your ‚Äúresponsive‚Äù layout is‚Ä¶ not responding. And on the web? Don‚Äôt even ask.

Sound familiar? Welcome to the wild world of Compose Multiplatform UI, where your design system needs to be a shape-shifter‚Äîelegant on Android, sharp on iOS, pixel-perfect on desktop, and snappy on the web.

This is the story of how Zomato built Sushi: a design system that‚Äôs as flexible as a yoga master, as consistent as your favorite restaurant‚Äôs dal makhani, and as fun as a Friday night order-in. üçõ

## The Problem: One Design, Infinite Screens ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Building a design system for Compose Multiplatform isn‚Äôt just about picking pretty colors or making buttons round. It‚Äôs about:

- **Device Fragmentation:** Phones, tablets, desktops, foldables, TVs, watches‚Ä¶ all with different DPIs, aspect ratios, and input methods.
- **Platform Quirks:** Android loves Material, iOS loves Cupertino, the web loves‚Ä¶ everything and nothing. Your design system needs to feel native everywhere, but still be unmistakably ‚Äúyou.‚Äù
- **Consistency vs. Flexibility:** You want your brand to shine through, but you also want to let teams customize, experiment, and move fast.
- **Performance:** Animations, gradients, and shadows are great‚Äîuntil your UI lags on a budget phone or a low-powered web browser.

The old ways? They don‚Äôt cut it:
- **Copy-paste design:** Leads to a Frankenstein‚Äôs monster of styles.
- **Platform-only libraries:** Great for one OS, but a pain everywhere else.
- **One-size-fits-none:** The ‚Äúaverage‚Äù device doesn‚Äôt exist.

We needed something better. Something delicious. üç£

## Introducing: Sushi! üç£

What if your design system could:
- **Look and feel amazing everywhere**‚Äîfrom Android to iOS, desktop to web?
- **Let you theme, customize, and extend** with just a few lines of code?
- **Ship with a buffet of ready-to-use components**‚Äîall beautiful, all consistent?
- **Scale from MVP to millions of users** (like we do at Zomato)?

That‚Äôs Sushi. It‚Äôs not just a design system‚Äîit‚Äôs a Compose Multiplatform superpower. And today, we‚Äôre open-sourcing it for everyone. üéâ

## ü•¢ Why Sushi?

- **Multiplatform First:** Write once, run everywhere Compose runs (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web, and more).
- **Production Proven:** Sushi powers Zomato, handling millions of users daily.
- **Composable & Extensible:** Built on Jetpack Compose idioms, with a focus on flexibility and customizability.
- **Beautiful by Default:** Carefully crafted color schemes, typography, and components.
- **Open Source:** Now available for everyone! üéâ

## üöÄ Getting Started

Add Sushi to your Compose Multiplatform project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.eternal.kits:sushi-compose")
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Foundation Layer: Theming, Colors, and Typography

### üé® Theming with `SushiTheme`

Sushi provides a powerful theming system, inspired by `MaterialTheme`, but tailored for Sushi's design language. Use `SushiTheme` to wrap your app or screen and provide consistent colors, typography, and dimensions throughout your UI.

```kotlin
SushiTheme(
    colorScheme = SushiColorScheme, // Choose from many built-in schemes!
    typography = SushiTypography,   // Customize or use defaults
    dimens = SushiDimension(),      // Spacing, corner radius, etc.
    fontSizeMultiplier = { it },    // For accessibility/font scaling
    colorTokenMapper = { SushiUnspecified.asColorSpec() } // Advanced: map tokens to colors
) {
    // Your UI here
}
```

#### `SushiTheme` Parameters
- `colorScheme`: The active color palette (see below for options!)
- `typography`: The font styles and weights
- `dimens`: Spacing and corner radius system
- `fontSizeMultiplier`: Function to scale font sizes (for accessibility)
- `colorTokenMapper`: Advanced mapping for custom color tokens

Access theme values anywhere in your composables:
```kotlin
val colors = SushiTheme.colors
val typography = SushiTheme.typography
val dimens = SushiTheme.dimens
```

---

### üåà Color Schemes

Sushi ships with a rich set of color schemes, each with light and dark variants. Some of the built-in schemes include **Red, Pink, Purple, Blue, Teal, Green, Yellow, Orange, Tangerine, Charcoal, Slate, Cider, Gold, Grey, Honey, Indigo, Lime, Onion, Avacado, Brown**

Each scheme is defined in `foundation/colorscheme/` and can be used like:
```kotlin
SushiTheme(colorScheme = sushiRedColorScheme()) { ... }
```

---

### üñåÔ∏è ColorSpec: Flexible Color Abstraction

Sushi introduces `ColorSpec`, a sealed interface that abstracts how colors are defined and accessed. This allows you to:
- Use Compose `Color` objects
- Use ARGB `Int` or `Long` values
- Use hex strings (e.g., `"#FF0000"`)
- Apply alpha transformations

#### Example Usage
```kotlin
val color1: ColorSpec = Color.Red.asColorSpec()
val color2: ColorSpec = 0xFFFF0000.toInt().asIntColorSpec()
val color3: ColorSpec = "#00FF00".asHexColorSpec()
val colorWithAlpha = color1.withAlpha(0.5f)
```

This makes it easy to theme and customize components, and to support dynamic or token-based color systems.

---

### üî§ TextTypeSpec: Powerful Typography

Typography in Sushi is handled via `TextTypeSpec`, a sealed interface that lets you:
- Use predefined text types (e.g., `SushiTextType.Regular400`)
- Wrap any Compose `TextStyle` as a spec
- Transform styles on the fly

#### Example Usage
```kotlin
val type: TextTypeSpec = SushiTextType.Bold700
val customType: TextTypeSpec = TextStyle(fontSize = 20.sp).asTextTypeSpec()
val modifiedType = type.transform { it.copy(letterSpacing = 1.sp) }
```

All text types are mapped to the theme‚Äôs typography, ensuring consistency across your app.
